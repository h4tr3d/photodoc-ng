Intro
=====

Installation is simple.

You must have installed:
  - Qt4 4.5 or higher
  - exiv2
  - libgphoto2 2.4.0 or higher

Devel packages should be installed also.


Get sources
===========

Download stable tarball from
  http://code.google.com/p/photodoc-ng/downloads/list

Or take sources from git:
  git clone http://git.gitorious.org/photodoc-ng/photodoc-ng.git

In near future I plane to add Windows prebuild binaryes (I think without gphoto2).


Build and install
=================

After, unpack source or take it from git and pass next comands:
  [1] mkdir build
  [2] cd build
  [3] lrelease ../photodoc.pro
  [4] qmake ../photodoc.pro
  [5] make
  [6] make install

On step [1] we create build directory and go to into on step [2].

On step [3] we update translations files, ignore next error message on this step:
  Project ERROR: Can't found one or more translations files. Run 'lrelease' on project file before 'qmake'

On step [4] we create Makefile and ready to build sources. Also, on this step we can add PREFIX options
to change default prefix '/usr/local':
  qmake ../photodoc.pro PREFIX=/usr

On step [5] we build sources, and on step [6] we install binaries into system. Also, 
for packages maintainers there is next pleasing option: ROOT_INSTALL that similar to DESTDIR in CMake and
autoconf:
  make INSTALL_ROOT=/tmp/pkg install

We also can uninstall PhotoDocNG with next command:
  make uninstall

Enjoy!
